### TO RUN THE APP

To run the app in development mode:
`npm start`

To run the app in production mode:
`npm run build`
`npx serve -s build`

### ABOUT THE DESIGN

- For styling the components **[@emotion/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emotion/react)** was chosen. Styles are placed in the same files that they are used in.
- Components have been made as small as possible / practical.
- Functions have been made as small as possible / practical.
- Functions (that components use) have often been placed outside of the component so that it would be easier to see what the component actually does.
